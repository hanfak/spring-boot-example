# First Spring app

First attempt at creating a spring web app

localhost:8080

1. Application class with spring runner set
    - need to have a controller, as when go to uri, nothing can handle request
2. Couple of end points  can be hit with GET request and a response is returned in BlogController.class
3. Use path variables in BlogController.class
    - Set context root and port using property file
    - http://localhost:8090/hanfak/ex/foos/1/Han
    - http://localhost:8090/hanfak/ex/foos/1
4. Use configuration to set port
    - http://localhost:8012/hanfak/ex/foos/1
5. Use path parameters
